		<p><h2>Answers for the lab 3 exercises:</h2></p>
		<ul>
			<li><h3>3.1</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li><h4>Compare and contrast the purposes of Node.js and of Express.js:</h4></li>
					<p><h6>Node.js is "a very powerful JavaScript-based framework/platform built on Google Chrome's JavaScript V8 Engine. It is used to develop I/O intensive web applications like video streaming sites, single-page applications, and other web applications," while Express is "a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications."  In other words, as best as I can understand it, if Node.js is like the coding 'engine' (the core programming mechanics) and Express provides development tools for that engine.  Node has a module library that includes utility functions for operating systems, file paths, and most usefully in this class, a network wrapper for server and client streams. Express is simply a framework that takes advantage of Node's capabilities for Web applications.</h6></p>
					<li><h4>Explain the purpose of the package.json file.</h4></li>
					<p><h6>The internet tells me that "a package.json file contains meta data about your app or module."  Our particular json package appears to have server, dependency, and author information.</h6></p>
				</ul>
			<li><h3>3.1</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li><h4>Explain the sense in which these files are “static”.</h4></li>
					<p><h6>The tutorial specifies that static files may be "images, CSS files, and JavaScript files." These are the files that give the page it's structure and content.  I think they are called static because they are merely served up to the client as read-only, unless interactive elements allow them to be changed.</h6></p>
					<li><h4>Determine whether the server continues to serve up the hello-world message and explain why this is the case.</h4></li>
					<p><h6>If I go to localhost:3000 instead of localhost:3000/index.html, the Hello World! message is indeed still sitting there.  No reason it shouldn't be, as near as I can tell.</h6></p>
