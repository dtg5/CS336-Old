Team members: Daniel Garcia and Lisa Terwilliger

Vision: Website for one of Calvinâ€™s student organizations, the Video Game Sphere. The home page will consist of a calendar highlighting events and a list of comments from the leadership about club activities. There will also be a tournament page where students can read about upcoming tournaments, results of past tournaments, and the rules for tournaments (static page). The only people who would be able to login and make posts to the website would be VGS leaders.
